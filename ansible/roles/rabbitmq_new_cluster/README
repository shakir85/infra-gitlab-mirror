This role sets up a RabbitMQ cluster. It is intended for a fresh RabbitMQ installation and should be run only once. Running it multiple times will disrupt the cluster, as each node might assume it is the disk (leader) node.

Re-setting the cluster requires additional `rabbitmqctl` commands to forget nodes, reset, and rejoin. This process is outside the scope of this role.
